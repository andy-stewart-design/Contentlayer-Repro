They can, in a word, be generative.\n\nIn her [essay on the subject](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/what-is-generative-art), artist Amy Goodchild identifies autonomy as the key element of generative artwork, and defines autonomy as \"a process not under direct human control.\" Her definition is purposefully expansive and academic—both [Jackson Pollack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock) and [Tyler Hobbes](https://tylerxhobbs.com/) are, in this conception, generative artists—so much so that I wonder if she's sacrificing clarity for comprehensiveness.\n\nFor the purposes of this post, I'm going to narrow the field a bit and say that generative design is:\n\n> A code-based solution for creating artwork based on a combination of explicit rules and planned spontaneity\n\nNot bad, but let's break that down a step further:\n\n- **code-based:** a simple way of saying that the work in question is produced by a set of instructions executed by a computer\n- **artwork:** the output of a generative creative process—most often either images or animations, though you can certainly create generative work in any medium\n- **explicit rules:** we're talking about art that is created indirectly through rule-based algorithms (not the scary ones). In a sense, generative art is more like knocking over dominoes than it is like drawing a picture.\n- **planned spontaneity:** generative works are almost always probabilistic in nature—which is to say that they rely on randomness and embrace elements that are intentionally beyond the control of the creator\n\nBorrowing an analogy from another art form, if others forms of art are like oil painting, where the creator has a high degree of control over the final output, generative design is more like water color. You purposefully sacrifice some level of direct control to the influence chance and happenstance—fully embracing so-called \"happy accidents.\" The imprecision of the medium is often times the point.\n\nTo demonstrate the point, let's look at a simple, elegant example of generative design: the [10 Print pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9joBLOZVEo).\n\nReferences\n[10 Print](https://10print.org/10_PRINT_121114.pdf) (Book)\n[The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEyTZ5ZZxZs)\n",
